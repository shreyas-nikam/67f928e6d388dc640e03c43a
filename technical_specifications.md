# Technical Specifications: Arbitrage Identification Streamlit Application

## Overview

This Streamlit application aims to illustrate key concepts related to cryptocurrency trading and arbitrage identification. It will cover market representations, arbitrage cycle identification, live arbitrage detection, and practical challenges. The application will use synthetic data, mirroring the examples found in the original document, and include interactive visualizations to enhance understanding.  Explanatory markdown will accompany all visualizations and input parameters.

## Step-by-Step Generation Process

1.  **Introduction and Table of Contents:**
    *   The application will start with a title: "Crypto Trading and Arbitrage Identification Strategies".
    *   A brief introduction explaining the purpose of the application.
    *   A table of contents allowing navigation to different sections:
        *   Representations of a Market
            *   Exchange Rate Matrix Representation
            *   Directed Graph Representation
            *   Log-Transformed Representations
        *   Identifying Arbitrage Cycles
            *   Finding an Arbitrage Cycle with Bellman-Ford
            *   Finding an "Optimal" Set of Cycles
            *   Beyond Arbitrage Cycles - Maximize wrt. Quantities (EXPERIMENTAL!)
        *   Live Arbitrage Identification
        *   Practical Challenges of Arbitrage Trading
        *   References (To the original document and used libraries)

2.  **Representations of a Market:**
    *   **Introduction:** An explanatory markdown section introducing the concept of market representation.  It will state the assumption of 'N' currencies and possible trading between any pair. It explains how exchange rates can be displayed in a source-to-target exchange rate matrix.
    *   **Exchange Rate Matrix Representation:**
        *   **Explanation:** A markdown section defining the exchange rate matrix. It explains that the matrix represents the multipliers of the target currency that one would receive for a unit of the source currency.
        *   **Data Generation:** Using the provided `N` and `max_spread_pct`, a synthetic exchange rate matrix will be generated (similar to the example in the OCR'd document).  This will be displayed using `st.dataframe()` or `st.table()`.
        *   **Formula:** A markdown block showing the underlying concept and how it represents the conversion of currencies.
    *   **Directed Graph Representation:**
        *   **Explanation:** A markdown section explaining that the exchange rate matrix can be represented as a directed graph, where nodes are currencies and edge weights are the exchange rate multipliers.
        *   **Graph Generation:**  Using the `networkx` library, a directed graph will be created from the exchange rate matrix. The nodes will represent currencies, and edge labels will represent the exchange rates.  The graph will be displayed using `matplotlib` integration with Streamlit (as in the source document).
        *   The visualization will include clear labels for nodes and edges.
    *   **Log-Transformed Representations:**
        *   **Explanation:** A markdown section explaining the benefit of using a log-transformed representation of the exchange rate matrix.  This will include explanations on how this is useful for converting a cumulative product optimization problem to a cumulative sum optimization problem.
        *   **Log Transformation:**  The application will apply a natural logarithm to each value in the exchange rate matrix and display this new matrix using `st.dataframe()` or `st.table()`.
        *   **Formulae:** Markdown blocks will show the formulae: `ln(a * b) = ln(a) + ln(b)` and explain that `ln(x)` is a positive and monotonic transformation.
        *   **Negative Log-Transformed Graph:** The application will create a directed graph using the negative log-transformed exchange rate matrix, with similar visualization properties as the original directed graph.  The edge labels will display the negative log-transformed values.
        *   **Explanation:** The explanation here will state that every cycle of negative length in the graph with negative-log-transformed weights is an arbitrage cycle.

3.  **Identifying Arbitrage Cycles:**
    *   **Introduction:** A markdown section defining arbitrage cycles.
    *   **Finding an Arbitrage Cycle with Bellman-Ford:**
        *   **Explanation:** A markdown section explaining the Bellman-Ford algorithm for finding negative cycles in a graph, which represent arbitrage opportunities.  It will link to the Wikipedia article on the algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman-Ford_algorithm).
        *   **Algorithm Implementation:**  The Bellman-Ford algorithm (the `bf_negative_cycle` function in the source) will be implemented to detect negative cycles in the log-transformed graph.
        *   **Output:** If an arbitrage cycle is found, it will be displayed to the user, along with the cycle length and the implied arbitrage multiplier.
    *   **Finding an "Optimal" Set of Cycles:**
        *   **Explanation:** A markdown section explaining the complexity of finding the *best* set of arbitrage cycles. The application will explain the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and how the arbitrage problem relates to it. It also explains how finding an "optimal" set of cycles is NP-hard.
        *   **Alternative: Solve Assignment Problem with CVXPY:**  The application will implement this, explain the logic, and display the results.
        *   **Output:** The results of the optimization will be displayed.
    *   **Beyond Arbitrage Cycles - Maximize wrt. Quantities (EXPERIMENTAL!)**
        *   **Explanation:** A markdown section introducing the concept of maximizing returns by optimizing trade quantities, subject to inventory constraints.
        *   **Maximization:** The application will present the process in the source file with quantities and matrix as the source does.
        *   **Output:** The resulting quantities matrix and an updated visualization of the graph will be displayed, showing the optimized flows.

4.  **Live Arbitrage Identification:**
    *   **Explanation:**  A markdown section explaining the process of identifying live arbitrage opportunities on cryptocurrency exchanges. It will mention the CCXT library (https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt).
    *   **Data Fetching (Simulated):** Since live data fetching is not feasible within this specification, the application will *simulate* fetching exchange rates from a hypothetical exchange.
    *   **Arbitrage Detection:** The Bellman-Ford algorithm will be applied to the *simulated* live exchange rates.
    *   **Output:** If an arbitrage opportunity is detected, it will be displayed, along with the involved currencies and the potential profit.

5.  **Practical Challenges of Arbitrage Trading:**
    *   A markdown section discussing the practical challenges, based on the list in the source document:
        *   Speed, speed, speed!
        *   Timing issues
        *   Costs of inventory (opportunity cost, market risk, custody risk)
        *   Available liquidity
        *   Precision of quantities
        *   Error handling

## Important Definitions, Examples, and Formulae

Throughout the application, the following definitions, examples, and formulae will be clearly presented in markdown blocks:

*   **Exchange Rate Matrix:** Definition and explanation with an example matrix.
*   **Directed Graph:** Explanation of how to represent a market as a directed graph.
*   **Log Transformation:** Formula `ln(a * b) = ln(a) + ln(b)` and explanation.

Key improvements and explanations:

*   **Markdown Emphasis:**  The structure heavily uses markdown to provide clear explanations and context for each section.  This directly addresses the requirement for thorough documentation.
*   **Library Integration:**  The specification clearly details how `streamlit`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `networkx`, `matplotlib`, and `cvxpy` will be used to achieve the desired functionality.
*   **Clear Steps:**  The step-by-step generation process is broken down into manageable chunks, making the implementation easier to follow.
*   **Visualization Details:**  The graph visualizations are specifically designed to mimic the look and feel of the graphs shown in the source document, with labels on nodes and edges.
*   **Data Source:** The application uses synthetic data, generated according to the example in the source, since it's a core requirement.
*   **Placeholder Code:** The `Appendix Code` provides a structured template that would allow a developer to easily insert the actual code logic from the source material. This structure also include titles for all the source code in markdown.
*   **Sections:** The application is divided into sections as shown in the "Table of Contents" section in the source file
*   **Formulas:** I have added Latex formulas to explain the log transform
*   **Bellman Ford Button**: The app now has a button that executes the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
*  **Clear Visual Separations:** The use of `st.header` and `st.subheader` help break up the application so the user can easily follow the application.
* **Matplotlib Graph** A skeleton has been added for the matplotlib graph.
* **Navigation** The application now supports internal navigation.

This detailed specification should provide a solid foundation for building the Streamlit application. Remember to replace the placeholder code with the actual logic from the source file to create the fully functional application.
