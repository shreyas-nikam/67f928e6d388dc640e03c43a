# QuLab Codelab: Exploring Arbitrage Opportunities

This codelab will guide you through the QuLab application, a tool designed to illustrate and explore arbitrage opportunities in financial markets. We'll cover various methods of representing market data, identifying potential arbitrage cycles, and discuss the practical challenges involved in arbitrage trading.  This application serves as an educational tool, demonstrating concepts rather than providing real-time trading capabilities.

## Understanding Market Representations
Duration: 00:05

This section focuses on the fundamental ways to represent market data to identify arbitrage opportunities. We'll explore exchange rate matrices and their graphical representations, along with log transformations for simplifying arbitrage detection.

## Exchange Rate Matrix
Duration: 00:10

The exchange rate matrix is the cornerstone of our market representation. Each cell (i, j) in the matrix represents the exchange rate from currency i to currency j.

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

# Example exchange rate matrix
exchange_rate_matrix = pd.DataFrame({
    0: [1.00, 0.58, 0.63, 0.27, 0.17, 0.20],
    1: [1.68, 1.00, 0.39, 0.74, 0.47, 0.79],
    2: [1.57, 2.48, 1.00, 0.04, 0.15, 0.11],
    3: [3.64, 1.35, 22.94, 1.00, 0.22, 0.23],
    4: [5.84, 2.02, 6.84, 4.40, 1.00, 0.49],
    5: [4.76, 1.21, 8.59, 4.41, 1.97, 1.00]
})

st.subheader("Exchange Rate Matrix Representation")
st.write("An exchange rate matrix displays the exchange rates between different currencies.")
st.dataframe(exchange_rate_matrix)
```

*   **Explanation:** The code snippet above creates a Pandas DataFrame representing the exchange rate matrix. `st.dataframe()` displays the matrix in the Streamlit application.  Each row and column represents a currency, and the value at `matrix[i][j]` represents the exchange rate from currency `i` to currency `j`.

## Directed Graph Representation
Duration: 00:15

We can visualize the exchange rate matrix as a directed graph where:

*   Nodes represent currencies.
*   Edges represent the exchange rates between currencies.
*   Edge weights represent the exchange rates.

```python
import networkx as nx
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# Directed Graph Representation
G = nx.DiGraph()
for i in range(len(exchange_rate_matrix)):
    for j in range(len(exchange_rate_matrix)):
        G.add_edge(i, j, weight=exchange_rate_matrix.iloc[i, j])

# Visualization with Plotly
pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
edge_x = []
edge_y = []
for edge in G.edges():
    x0, y0 = pos[edge[0]]
    x1, y1 = pos[edge[1]]
    edge_x.append(x0)
    edge_y.append(y0)
    edge_x.append(x1)
    edge_y.append(y1)
    edge_x.append(None)
    edge_y.append(None)

edge_trace = go.Scatter(
    x=edge_x, y=edge_y,
    line=dict(width=0.5, color='#888'),
    hoverinfo='none',
    mode='lines')

node_x = []
node_y = []
for node in G.nodes():
    x, y = pos[node]
    node_x.append(x)
    node_y.append(y)

node_trace = go.Scatter(
    x=node_x, y=node_y,
    mode='markers',
    hoverinfo='text',
    marker=dict(
        showscale=True,
        colorscale='YlGnBu',
        reversescale=True,
        color=[],
        size=10,
        colorbar=dict(
            thickness=15,
            title='Node Connections',
            xanchor='left',
            titleside='right'
        ),
        line_width=2))

node_adjacencies = []
node_text = []
for node, adjacencies in enumerate(G.adjacency()):
    node_adjacencies.append(len(adjacencies[1]))
    node_text.append(f"Currency {node}")

node_trace.marker.color = node_adjacencies
node_trace.text = node_text

fig = go.Figure(data=[edge_trace, node_trace],
                layout=go.Layout(
                    title='Directed Graph Representation',
                    titlefont_size=16,
                    showlegend=False,
                    hovermode='closest',
                    margin=dict(b=20, l=5, r=5, t=40),
                    annotations=[dict(
                        text="A directed graph represents currencies as nodes and exchange rates as edges.",
                        showarrow=False,
                        xref="paper", yref="paper",
                        x=0.005, y=-0.002)],
                    xaxis=dict(showgrid=False, zeroline=False, showticklabels=False),
                    yaxis=dict(showgrid=False, zeroline=False, showticklabels=False))
                )
st.subheader("Directed Graph Representation")
st.write("A directed graph represents currencies as nodes and exchange rates as edges.")
st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)
```

*   **Explanation:** This code uses the `networkx` library to create a directed graph from the exchange rate matrix.  The `plotly` library is then used to visualize this graph.  Nodes represent currencies, and the edges represent the exchange rates. The layout is configured for better presentation within the Streamlit app.  This visualization helps in identifying potential arbitrage cycles more intuitively.

## Log-Transformed Representations
Duration: 00:10

To simplify the detection of arbitrage opportunities, we apply a log transformation to the exchange rates. This converts the multiplicative problem of finding arbitrage cycles into an additive problem, making it easier to solve using algorithms like Bellman-Ford.

```python
import numpy as np

# Log-transformed exchange rate matrix
log_exchange_rate_matrix = -np.log(exchange_rate_matrix)
log_exchange_rate_matrix = pd.DataFrame(log_exchange_rate_matrix)
st.subheader("Log-Transformed Representations")
st.write("Log transformation converts multiplicative arbitrage detection into an additive problem.")
st.dataframe(log_exchange_rate_matrix)
```

*   **Explanation:** This code calculates the negative logarithm of each exchange rate in the matrix. The negative sign is used because arbitrage opportunities are identified by *negative* cycles in the log-transformed graph.

## Log-Transformed Directed Graph
Duration: 00:15

We create a directed graph from the log-transformed exchange rate matrix, similar to the previous graph representation.

```python
# Create a directed graph from the log-transformed matrix
G_log = nx.DiGraph()
for i in range(len(log_exchange_rate_matrix)):
    for j in range(len(log_exchange_rate_matrix)):
        G_log.add_edge(i, j, weight=log_exchange_rate_matrix.iloc[i, j])

# Visualization with Plotly (similar to the previous graph visualization)
pos_log = nx.spring_layout(G_log)
edge_x_log = []
edge_y_log = []
for edge in G_log.edges():
    x0, y0 = pos_log[edge[0]]
    x1, y1 = pos_log[edge[1]]
    edge_x_log.append(x0)
    edge_y_log.append(y0)
    edge_x_log.append(x1)
    edge_y_log.append(y1)
    edge_x_log.append(None)
    edge_y_log.append(None)

edge_trace_log = go.Scatter(
    x=edge_x_log, y=edge_y_log,
    line=dict(width=0.5, color='#888'),
    hoverinfo='none',
    mode='lines')

node_x_log = []
node_y_log = []
for node in G_log.nodes():
    x, y = pos_log[node]
    node_x_log.append(x)
    node_y_log.append(y)

node_trace_log = go.Scatter(
    x=node_x_log, y=node_y_log,
    mode='markers',
    hoverinfo='text',
    marker=dict(
        showscale=True,
        colorscale='YlGnBu',
        reversescale=True,
        color=[],
        size=10,
        colorbar=dict(
            thickness=15,
            title='Node Connections',
            xanchor='left',
            titleside='right'
        ),
        line_width=2))

node_adjacencies_log = []
node_text_log = []
for node, adjacencies in enumerate(G_log.adjacency()):
    node_adjacencies_log.append(len(adjacencies[1]))
    node_text_log.append(f"Currency {node}")

node_trace_log.marker.color = node_adjacencies_log
node_trace_log.text = node_text_log

fig_log = go.Figure(data=[edge_trace_log, node_trace_log],
                layout=go.Layout(
                    title='Log-Transformed Directed Graph Representation',
                    titlefont_size=16,
                    showlegend=False,
                    hovermode='closest',
                    margin=dict(b=20, l=5, r=5, t=40),
                    annotations=[dict(
                        text="A directed graph represents currencies as nodes and exchange rates as edges.",
                        showarrow=False,
                        xref="paper", yref="paper",
                        x=0.005, y=-0.002)],
                    xaxis=dict(showgrid=False, zeroline=False, showticklabels=False),
                    yaxis=dict(showgrid=False, zeroline=False, showticklabels=False))
                )

st.plotly_chart(fig_log, use_container_width=True)
```

*   **Explanation:** This is very similar to the previous graph visualization, but it uses the log-transformed exchange rates as edge weights.  This transformation is crucial for the next step, where we'll use the Bellman-Ford algorithm to identify negative cycles, which indicate arbitrage opportunities.

## Identifying Arbitrage Cycles
Duration: 00:05

This section focuses on using the Bellman-Ford algorithm to identify arbitrage cycles within the log-transformed graph. An arbitrage cycle exists when a sequence of currency exchanges results in a profit, which translates to a negative cycle in the log-transformed graph.

## Bellman-Ford Algorithm
Duration: 00:20

The Bellman-Ford algorithm is used to detect negative cycles in a graph.  In our context, a negative cycle signifies an arbitrage opportunity.

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

st.subheader("Finding an Arbitrage Cycle with Bellman-Ford")
st.write("The Bellman-Ford algorithm detects negative cycles, indicating arbitrage opportunities in the log-transformed graph.")

# Example exchange rate matrix (same as in representations.py)
exchange_rate_matrix = pd.DataFrame({
    0: [1.00, 0.58, 0.63, 0.27, 0.17, 0.20],
    1: [1.68, 1.00, 0.39, 0.74, 0.47, 0.79],
    2: [1.57, 2.48, 1.00, 0.04, 0.15, 0.11],
    3: [3.64, 1.35, 22.94, 1.00, 0.22, 0.23],
    4: [5.84, 2.02, 6.84, 4.40, 1.00, 0.49],
    5: [4.76, 1.21, 8.59, 4.41, 1.97, 1.00]
})

# Log-transformed exchange rate matrix
log_exchange_rate_matrix = -np.log(exchange_rate_matrix)
log_exchange_rate_matrix = pd.DataFrame(log_exchange_rate_matrix)

# Create a directed graph from the log-transformed matrix
G_log = nx.DiGraph()
for i in range(len(log_exchange_rate_matrix)):
    for j in range(len(log_exchange_rate_matrix)):
        G_log.add_edge(i, j, weight=log_exchange_rate_matrix.iloc[i, j])


# Bellman-Ford Algorithm (Simplified for demonstration)
def bf_negative_cycle(graph):
    dist = {node: float('inf') for node in graph.nodes()}
    pred = {node: None for node in graph.nodes()}
    start_node = 0
    dist[start_node] = 0

    for _ in range(len(graph.nodes()) - 1):
        for u, v, weight in graph.edges(data='weight'):
            if dist[u] != float('inf') and dist[u] + weight < dist[v]:
                dist[v] = dist[u] + weight
                pred[v] = u

        for u, v, weight in graph.edges(data='weight'):
            if dist[u] != float('inf') and dist[u] + weight < dist[v]:
                # Negative cycle detected. Construct the cycle.
                cycle = []
                curr = v
                visited = {node: False for node in graph.nodes()}
                while not visited[curr]:
                    visited[curr] = True
                    cycle.append(curr)
                    curr = pred[curr]
                    if curr is None:
                        return None # No cycle
                cycle.append(curr)
                return cycle[::-1]  # Reverse the cycle to the correct order
        return None


    arbitrage_cycle = bf_negative_cycle(G_log)

    if arbitrage_cycle:
        st.write("Arbitrage Cycle Found:", arbitrage_cycle)
        cycle_weight = sum(G_log[arbitrage_cycle[i]][arbitrage_cycle[(i + 1) % len(arbitrage_cycle)]]['weight']
                           for i in range(len(arbitrage_cycle)])
        arbitrage_multiplier = np.exp(-cycle_weight) #undo log transform and negative
        st.write("Arbitrage Multiplier:", arbitrage_multiplier)
    else:
        st.write("No Arbitrage Cycle Found.")
```

*   **Explanation:**
    *   The `bf_negative_cycle` function implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
    *   It initializes distances to infinity for all nodes except the starting node (node 0).
    *   It iterates through the edges of the graph `|V| - 1` times, where `|V|` is the number of nodes, relaxing the edges (updating distances) if a shorter path is found.
    *   After the iterations, it checks for negative cycles by iterating through the edges again. If a shorter path is still found, it indicates a negative cycle.
    *   If a negative cycle is detected, the function reconstructs the cycle by backtracking from the node where the shorter path was found.
    *   The `arbitrage_multiplier` is calculated by exponentiating the negative of the cycle weight. This represents the profit you would make by trading along the cycle.

## Optimal Set of Cycles (Theoretical)
Duration: 00:05

The application mentions finding the "optimal" set of cycles. In reality, finding the *absolute best* set of arbitrage trades is an NP-hard problem. The application alludes to using linear programming relaxation via CVXPY, but the actual implementation is omitted.

```python
st.subheader("Finding an 'Optimal' Set of Cycles")
st.write("Finding the absolute best set of arbitrage trades is computationally hard (NP-hard). This section would demonstrate a simplified problem using linear programming relaxation via CVXPY.")
st.write("CVXPY Implementation is omitted due to not being required in the simplified specification.")
```

*   **Explanation:** This section acknowledges the complexity of finding the globally optimal arbitrage strategy and indicates that more advanced techniques like linear programming with CVXPY could be used, but are not implemented in this simplified demo.

## Live Arbitrage Identification
Duration: 00:05

This section would ideally demonstrate live arbitrage identification using real-time data from cryptocurrency exchanges or other financial markets.  However, due to the complexity of integrating with live data feeds and the limitations of the Streamlit environment, a live implementation is not included.

```python
import streamlit as st

def run_live_arbitrage():
    st.subheader("Live Arbitrage Identification")
    st.write("This section would demonstrate live arbitrage identification using real-time data from cryptocurrency exchanges.")
    st.write("The CCXT library could be used to fetch the live data. However, due to the complexity and limitations of this environment, a live implementation is not included in this demonstration.")
    st.write("Instead, this section serves as a placeholder to indicate where live arbitrage identification would be implemented in a real-world application.")
```

*   **Explanation:** The code indicates where a real-time data integration would be placed. The `CCXT` library is a popular choice for accessing cryptocurrency exchange data.

<aside class="negative">
<b>Important:</b> Implementing live arbitrage trading requires careful consideration of exchange APIs, rate limits, transaction costs, and robust error handling.

## Practical Challenges of Arbitrage Trading
Duration: 00:10

This section outlines the practical challenges that arbitrage traders face in real-world scenarios.

```python
import streamlit as st

def run_challenges():
    st.subheader("Practical Challenges of Arbitrage Trading")
    st.write("Arbitrage trading, while potentially profitable, faces several practical challenges:")
    st.markdown("""
