# QuLab Codelab: Exploring Arbitrage Opportunities

## Introduction
Duration: 00:05

Welcome to the QuLab codelab! This application is designed to demonstrate the principles of arbitrage in financial markets, specifically focusing on currency exchange. Arbitrage, in simple terms, is the simultaneous buying and selling of an asset in different markets to profit from tiny differences in the asset's listed price. This codelab will guide you through the functionalities of QuLab, explaining key concepts such as market representation, arbitrage cycle identification using the Bellman-Ford algorithm, and the practical challenges associated with arbitrage trading. By the end of this codelab, you will have a solid understanding of how this application works and the theoretical underpinnings of arbitrage detection.

## Representations of a Market
Duration: 00:15

In this section, we will explore how a market, specifically currency exchange rates, can be represented in two key formats: an Exchange Rate Matrix and a Directed Graph. Understanding these representations is crucial for identifying potential arbitrage opportunities.

### Exchange Rate Matrix
Duration: 00:05

An Exchange Rate Matrix is a tabular representation where each cell (i, j) contains the exchange rate from currency i to currency j.  Let's examine the matrix used in QuLab.

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx
import plotly.graph_objects as go

def plot_nx_graph(G, title):
    pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)
    edge_x = []
    edge_y = []
    for edge in G.edges(data=True):
        x0, y0 = pos[edge[0]]
        x1, y1 = pos[edge[1]]
        edge_x.extend([x0, x1, None])
        edge_y.extend([y0, y1, None])
    edge_trace = go.Scatter(
        x=edge_x, y=edge_y,
        line=dict(width=2, color='#888'),
        hoverinfo='none',
        mode='lines')

    node_x = []
    node_y = []
    for node in G.nodes():
        x, y = pos[node]
        node_x.append(x)
        node_y.append(y)
    node_trace = go.Scatter(
        x=node_x, y=node_y,
        mode='markers+text',
        text=[str(node) for node in G.nodes()],
        textposition="bottom center",
        marker=dict(
            color='pink',
            size=20,
            line_width=2))

    fig = go.Figure(data=[edge_trace, node_trace],
                    layout=go.Layout(
                        title=title,
                        titlefont_size=16,
                        showlegend=False,
                        hovermode='closest',
                        margin=dict(b=20, l=5, r=5, t=40)))
    return fig

def app():
    st.subheader("Representations of a Market")
    st.write("Below is an explanation and visualization of the exchange rate matrix and its directed graph representation.")

    # Exchange rate matrix representation
    exchange_rate_matrix = pd.DataFrame({
        0: [1.00, 0.58, 0.63, 0.27, 0.17, 0.20],
        1: [1.68, 1.00, 0.39, 0.74, 0.47, 0.79],
        2: [1.57, 2.48, 1.00, 0.04, 0.15, 0.11],
        3: [3.64, 1.35, 22.94, 1.00, 0.22, 0.23],
        4: [5.84, 2.02, 6.84, 4.40, 1.00, 0.49],
        5: [4.76, 1.21, 8.59, 4.41, 1.97, 1.00]
    })
    st.markdown("### Exchange Rate Matrix Representation")
    st.write("An exchange rate matrix displays the exchange rates between different currencies. Each cell (i, j) represents the rate at which currency i can be exchanged for currency j.")
    st.dataframe(exchange_rate_matrix)

    # ... rest of the code in market.py ...

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app()
```

In `pages/market.py`, you can see the following Pandas DataFrame representing the exchange rate matrix:

```python
exchange_rate_matrix = pd.DataFrame({
    0: [1.00, 0.58, 0.63, 0.27, 0.17, 0.20],
    1: [1.68, 1.00, 0.39, 0.74, 0.47, 0.79],
    2: [1.57, 2.48, 1.00, 0.04, 0.15, 0.11],
    3: [3.64, 1.35, 22.94, 1.00, 0.22, 0.23],
    4: [5.84, 2.02, 6.84, 4.40, 1.00, 0.49],
    5: [4.76, 1.21, 8.59, 4.41, 1.97, 1.00]
})
```
Here, the indices and column names (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) represent different currencies. For example, the value at `exchange_rate_matrix.iloc[0, 1]` (which is 0.58) indicates that 1 unit of currency 0 can be exchanged for 0.58 units of currency 1.

### Directed Graph Representation
Duration: 00:05

The Exchange Rate Matrix can be further visualized as a Directed Graph. In this graph:
- **Nodes** represent currencies.
- **Edges** represent the exchange rate from one currency to another, with the edge weight being the exchange rate.

QuLab uses the `networkx` library to create and visualize this graph using `plotly`.

```python
    # Create directed graph from exchange rate matrix and visualize with Plotly
    G = nx.DiGraph()
    n = len(exchange_rate_matrix)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            G.add_edge(i, j, weight=exchange_rate_matrix.iloc[i, j])
    st.markdown("### Directed Graph Representation")
    st.write("A directed graph represents the market where nodes are currencies and edges (with weights) represent exchange rates.")
    fig1 = plot_nx_graph(G, "Exchange Rate Graph")
    st.plotly_chart(fig1, use_container_width=True)
```

The `plot_nx_graph` function is a helper function to visualize the `networkx` graph using `plotly`. It positions the nodes using `spring_layout` and creates scatter plots for edges and nodes to render the graph.

</aside>

### Log-Transformed Representation
Duration: 00:05

To convert the multiplicative arbitrage problem into an additive one, we take the negative logarithm of the exchange rates. This transformation is essential for using algorithms like Bellman-Ford, which are designed for additive weights to detect negative cycles.

```python
    # Log-transformed representations
    st.markdown("### Log-Transformed Representations")
    st.write("Taking the negative logarithm of the exchange rates transforms the multiplicative arbitrage problem into an additive one.")
    log_exchange_rate_matrix = -np.log(exchange_rate_matrix)
    log_exchange_rate_matrix = pd.DataFrame(log_exchange_rate_matrix)
    st.dataframe(log_exchange_rate_matrix)

    # Create directed graph from log-transformed matrix
    G_log = nx.DiGraph()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            G_log.add_edge(i, j, weight=log_exchange_rate_matrix.iloc[i, j])
    fig2 = plot_nx_graph(G_log, "Log-Transformed Exchange Rate Graph")
    st.plotly_chart(fig2, use_container_width=True)
```

As shown in the code, we calculate the negative logarithm of the `exchange_rate_matrix` and create a new directed graph `G_log` with these log-transformed weights. This log-transformed graph is crucial for the next step: identifying arbitrage cycles.

## Identifying Arbitrage Cycles
Duration: 00:20

This section focuses on identifying arbitrage opportunities, which in graph terms, are represented as negative cycles in the log-transformed exchange rate graph. We use the Bellman-Ford algorithm to detect these cycles.

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

def bf_negative_cycle(graph):
    nodes = list(graph.nodes())
    dist = {node: float('inf') for node in nodes}
    pred = {node: None for node in nodes}
    start_node = nodes[0]
    dist[start_node] = 0
    for _ in range(len(nodes)-1):
        for u, v, data in graph.edges(data=True):
            if dist[u] + data['weight'] < dist[v]:
                dist[v] = dist[u] + data['weight']
                pred[v] = u
    # Check for negative cycles
    for u, v, data in graph.edges(data=True):
        if dist[u] + data['weight'] < dist[v]:
            cycle = []
            cur = v
            visited = set()
            while cur not in visited:
                visited.add(cur)
                cur = pred[cur]
                if cur is None:
                    break
            if cur is None:
                continue
            cycle_start = cur
            cycle = [cycle_start]
            cur = pred[cycle_start]
            while cur != cycle_start:
                cycle.append(cur)
                cur = pred[cur]
            cycle.append(cycle_start)
            return cycle[::-1]
    return None

def app():
    st.subheader("Identifying Arbitrage Cycles")
    st.write("The Bellman-Ford algorithm is used below on the log-transformed exchange rate graph to detect negative cycles (potential arbitrage opportunities).")

    # Recreate the log-transformed exchange rate matrix from static data
    exchange_rate_matrix = pd.DataFrame({
        0: [1.00, 0.58, 0.63, 0.27, 0.17, 0.20],
        1: [1.68, 1.00, 0.39, 0.74, 0.47, 0.79],

        st.write("Arbitrage Cycle Found:", arbitrage_cycle)
        cycle_weight = 0
        for i in range(len(arbitrage_cycle)-1):
            u = arbitrage_cycle[i]
            v = arbitrage_cycle[i+1]
            cycle_weight += G_log[u][v]['weight']
        arbitrage_multiplier = np.exp(-cycle_weight)
        st.write("Arbitrage Multiplier:", arbitrage_multiplier)
    else:
        st.write("No Arbitrage Cycle Found.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app()
```

### Bellman-Ford Algorithm for Negative Cycle Detection
Duration: 00:10

The `bf_negative_cycle` function in `pages/arbitrage.py` implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm. Here's a breakdown:

```python
def bf_negative_cycle(graph):
    nodes = list(graph.nodes())
    dist = {node: float('inf') for node in nodes} # Initialize distances to infinity
    pred = {node: None for node in nodes} # Initialize predecessors to None
    start_node = nodes[0]
    dist[start_node] = 0 # Set distance from start node to itself as 0

    # Relax edges repeatedly
    for _ in range(len(nodes)-1):
        for u, v, data in graph.edges(data=True):
            if dist[u] + data['weight'] < dist[v]: # Relaxation condition
                dist[v] = dist[u] + data['weight'] # Update distance
                pred[v] = u # Update predecessor

    # Check for negative cycles in the last iteration
    for u, v, data in graph.edges(data=True):
        if dist[u] + data['weight'] < dist[v]: # If distance can still be reduced, negative cycle exists
            cycle = []
            cur = v
            visited = set()
            # Backtrack to find the cycle
            while cur not in visited:
                visited.add(cur)
                cur = pred[cur]
                if cur is None:
                    break
            if cur is None:
                continue
            cycle_start = cur
            cycle = [cycle_start]
            cur = pred[cycle_start]
            while cur != cycle_start:
                cycle.append(cur)
                cur = pred[cur]
            cycle.append(cycle_start)
            return cycle[::-1] # Return the negative cycle

    return None # No negative cycle found
```

1. **Initialization:** Distances to all nodes are initialized to infinity, except for the starting node, which is set to 0. Predecessor pointers are initialized to `None`.
2. **Relaxation:** The algorithm iterates `|V|-1` times (where `|V|` is the number of nodes). In each iteration, it relaxes all edges. Relaxing an edge (u, v) means checking if the path to v through u is shorter than the current distance to v. If it is, the distance to v and the predecessor of v are updated.
3. **Negative Cycle Detection:** After `|V|-1` iterations, if we can still relax any edge, it indicates the presence of a negative cycle. The algorithm then backtracks using the predecessor pointers to reconstruct the cycle.

### Arbitrage Cycle and Multiplier
Duration: 00:05

If a negative cycle is detected, QuLab identifies it as a potential arbitrage cycle. The application then calculates the "Arbitrage Multiplier".

```python
    arbitrage_cycle = bf_negative_cycle(G_log)
    if arbitrage_cycle:
        st.write("Arbitrage Cycle Found:", arbitrage_cycle)
        cycle_weight = 0
        for i in range(len(arbitrage_cycle)-1):
            u = arbitrage_cycle[i]
            v = arbitrage_cycle[i+1]
            cycle_weight += G_log[u][v]['weight'] # Sum of log-transformed weights in the cycle
        arbitrage_multiplier = np.exp(-cycle_weight) # Convert back to multiplicative factor
        st.write("Arbitrage Multiplier:", arbitrage_multiplier)
    else:
        st.write("No Arbitrage Cycle Found.")
```

The `arbitrage_multiplier` is calculated by exponentiating the negative of the sum of the log-transformed edge weights in the cycle. If this multiplier is greater than 1, it indicates a profitable arbitrage opportunity. For example, an arbitrage multiplier of 1.05 means that for every 1 unit of currency you start with, you can end up with 1.05 units after completing the cycle, resulting in a 5% profit (before considering transaction costs).

<aside class="negative">
  <b>Important Note:</b> The presence of a negative cycle only indicates a *potential* arbitrage opportunity. Real-world factors like transaction costs and execution speed are not considered here.
</aside>

## Live Arbitrage Identification
Duration: 00:05

The "Live Arbitrage Identification" page in QuLab is a conceptual demonstration of how real-time arbitrage detection could be implemented.

```python
import streamlit as st

def app():
    st.subheader("Live Arbitrage Identification")
    st.write("In a production environment, live data from cryptocurrency exchanges would be fetched using libraries such as CCXT to identify arbitrage opportunities in real-time.")
    st.markdown("**Note:** This is a simulated demonstration. Live data functionality is not implemented in this demo.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app()
```

As explained in `pages/live_arbitrage.py`, in a live trading environment, you would use libraries like CCXT (CryptoCurrency eXchange Trading Library) to fetch real-time exchange rate data from various cryptocurrency exchanges. This data would then be used to construct the exchange rate matrix and the log-transformed graph dynamically. The Bellman-Ford algorithm would be run periodically to detect arbitrage opportunities in real-time.

<aside class="positive">
  <b>Further Exploration:</b>  Investigate CCXT and other similar libraries to understand how to fetch live market data for building a real-time arbitrage detection system.
</aside>

## Practical Challenges of Arbitrage Trading
Duration: 00:10

Arbitrage trading, while theoretically profitable, faces numerous practical challenges. The "Practical Challenges of Arbitrage Trading" page in QuLab highlights these issues.

```python
import streamlit as st

def app():
    st.subheader("Practical Challenges of Arbitrage Trading")
    st.write("Arbitrage trading, while promising in theory, faces several practical challenges in the real world:")
    st.markdown("""
    - **Speed and Timing Issues:** Rapid market movements require lightning-fast execution.
    - **Transaction Costs:** Fees and spreads can significantly reduce or eliminate profits.
    - **Liquidity Constraints:** Not all markets have the depth required for large arbitrage trades.
    - **Error Handling:** Data discrepancies and connectivity issues can adversely impact trading.
    - **Regulatory Concerns:** Diverse legal frameworks can limit or complicate arbitrage strategies.
    """)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app()
```

As listed in `pages/challenges.py`, some of the key challenges include:

- **Speed and Timing Issues:** Arbitrage opportunities are often short-lived. High-speed infrastructure and algorithms are required to execute trades quickly.
- **Transaction Costs:** Exchange fees and spreads can eat into the small profit margins of arbitrage trades, potentially making them unprofitable.
- **Liquidity Constraints:** Sufficient liquidity is needed to execute large trades without significantly moving the market prices, which can eliminate the arbitrage opportunity.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is crucial to deal with data inaccuracies, connectivity problems, and execution failures, which can lead to losses.
- **Regulatory Concerns:** Different jurisdictions have varying regulations on arbitrage trading, which can complicate operations and limit strategy deployment.

<aside class="negative">
  <b>Real-world Consideration:</b> Always consider these practical challenges when evaluating the feasibility of arbitrage strategies. Theoretical profitability does not always translate to real-world profits.
</aside>

## Conclusion
Duration: 00:05

This codelab provided a comprehensive overview of the QuLab application, covering market representations, arbitrage cycle identification using the Bellman-Ford algorithm, and the practical challenges of arbitrage trading. You should now have a clear understanding of how QuLab demonstrates arbitrage principles and the complexities involved in real-world arbitrage strategies. Remember that QuLab is primarily for educational purposes, and actual arbitrage trading involves significant risks and requires sophisticated infrastructure and risk management strategies.
