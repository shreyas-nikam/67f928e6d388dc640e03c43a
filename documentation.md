# QuLab Codelab: Exploring Arbitrage Opportunities

This codelab will guide you through the QuLab application, a Streamlit-based tool designed to explore and identify arbitrage opportunities in financial markets. Arbitrage is a fundamental concept in finance, representing the possibility of risk-free profit by exploiting price discrepancies of an asset across different markets. This application demonstrates key concepts and algorithms used in arbitrage detection. By the end of this codelab, you will understand how QuLab represents market data, identifies potential arbitrage cycles, and highlights the practical challenges associated with arbitrage trading.

## Exploring Representations of a Market
Duration: 00:15

This section focuses on how market data, specifically exchange rates, can be represented in different formats suitable for arbitrage detection.

1.  **Exchange Rate Matrix:** The application starts with a simple exchange rate matrix. This matrix displays the exchange rates between different currencies. Each cell (i, j) represents the exchange rate from currency i to currency j.
    ```python
    exchange_rate_matrix = pd.DataFrame({
        0: [1.00, 0.58, 0.63, 0.27, 0.17, 0.20],
        1: [1.68, 1.00, 0.39, 0.74, 0.47, 0.79],
        2: [1.57, 2.48, 1.00, 0.04, 0.15, 0.11],
        3: [3.64, 1.35, 22.94, 1.00, 0.22, 0.23],
        4: [5.84, 2.02, 6.84, 4.40, 1.00, 0.49],
        5: [4.76, 1.21, 8.59, 4.41, 1.97, 1.00]
    })
    ```

2.  **Directed Graph Representation:** The exchange rate matrix is then converted into a directed graph. Currencies are represented as nodes, and the exchange rates between them are represented as edges. The weight of each edge corresponds to the exchange rate. This representation allows us to visualize the relationships between currencies and use graph algorithms to detect arbitrage opportunities.
    ```python
    G = nx.DiGraph()
    for i in range(len(exchange_rate_matrix)):
        for j in range(len(exchange_rate_matrix)):
            G.add_edge(i, j, weight=exchange_rate_matrix.iloc[i, j])
    ```
    The application uses `networkx` library to create and visualize the graph. The `spring_layout` function is used to position the nodes in the graph for better readability.  The weights are displayed on the edges.

3. **Log-Transformed Representation:** To convert the multiplicative problem of finding arbitrage opportunities into an additive problem (which is easier to solve with algorithms like Bellman-Ford), the logarithm of the exchange rates is taken. The negative of the log is used to convert the problem of finding a cycle with a product greater than 1 into finding a negative cycle.
    ```python
    log_exchange_rate_matrix = -np.log(exchange_rate_matrix)
    ```
    The log-transformed matrix is also displayed as a dataframe and converted into a directed graph, similar to the original exchange rate matrix.

<aside class="positive">
<b>Key Concept:</b> Log transformation is a crucial step in arbitrage detection as it simplifies the problem from multiplicative to additive, making it easier to apply graph algorithms.

## Identifying Arbitrage Cycles with Bellman-Ford Algorithm
Duration: 00:20

This section demonstrates how the Bellman-Ford algorithm can be used to identify arbitrage cycles in the log-transformed graph.

1.  **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:** The `bf_negative_cycle` function implements a simplified version of the Bellman-Ford algorithm.  The algorithm iterates through all the edges of the graph multiple times, relaxing the distances between nodes.  If after `|V|-1` iterations, where `|V|` is the number of vertices, there is still a possibility to relax the distances, it means there is a negative cycle in the graph.

    ```python
    def bf_negative_cycle(graph):
        dist = {node: float('inf') for node in graph.nodes()}
        pred = {node: None for node in graph.nodes()}
        start_node = 0
        dist[start_node] = 0

        for _ in range(len(graph.nodes()) - 1):
            for u, v, weight in graph.edges(data='weight'):
                if dist[u] != float('inf') and dist[u] + weight < dist[v]:
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + weight
                    pred[v] = u

        for u, v, weight in graph.edges(data='weight'):
            if dist[u] != float('inf') and dist[u] + weight < dist[v]:
                # Negative cycle detected. Construct the cycle.
                cycle = []
                curr = v
                visited = {node: False for node in graph.nodes()}
                while not visited[curr]:
                    visited[curr] = True
                    cycle.append(curr)
                    curr = pred[curr]
                    if curr is None:
                        return None # No cycle
                cycle.append(curr)
                return cycle[::-1]  # Reverse the cycle to the correct order
        return None
    ```

2.  **Arbitrage Cycle Detection:** If a negative cycle is detected, it indicates an arbitrage opportunity. The application displays the identified arbitrage cycle, which is a sequence of currencies that, when traded in a specific order, result in a profit. The arbitrage multiplier is also calculated and displayed, which is the factor by which the initial capital would be multiplied if the arbitrage cycle is executed.

    ```python
    arbitrage_cycle = bf_negative_cycle(G_log)

    if arbitrage_cycle:
        st.write("Arbitrage Cycle Found:", arbitrage_cycle)
        cycle_weight = sum(G_log[arbitrage_cycle[i]][arbitrage_cycle[(i + 1) % len(arbitrage_cycle)]]['weight']
                           for i in range(len(arbitrage_cycle)))
        arbitrage_multiplier = np.exp(-cycle_weight) #undo log transform and negative
        st.write("Arbitrage Multiplier:", arbitrage_multiplier)
    else:
        st.write("No Arbitrage Cycle Found.")
    ```

<aside class="negative">
<b>Important Note:</b> The Bellman-Ford algorithm is sensitive to the order of edge relaxation, and the identified cycle might not always be the most profitable one.
