# QuLab Codelab: Exploring Arbitrage Opportunities

This codelab will guide you through the QuLab application, a Streamlit-based tool designed to illustrate and explore arbitrage opportunities in financial markets, particularly focusing on cryptocurrency exchanges. Arbitrage, the practice of profiting from price differences for the same asset across different markets, is a fundamental concept in finance. This application aims to provide an intuitive understanding of how arbitrage opportunities can be identified and the practical challenges associated with exploiting them.

The application uses concepts like:

*   **Exchange Rate Matrix:** Representing the rates between different currencies or assets.
*   **Graph Theory:** Modeling markets as directed graphs to visualize relationships and potential arbitrage cycles.
*   **Log Transformation:** Converting multiplicative problems into additive ones for easier computation.
*   **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:** Detecting negative cycles in graphs, which indicate arbitrage opportunities.
*   **Streamlit:** Building interactive web applications.

This codelab will walk you through each section of the QuLab application, explaining the underlying concepts and the implementation details.  It will cover representations of a market, identification of arbitrage cycles, a placeholder for live arbitrage identification, and a discussion of the practical challenges involved.

## Setting Up the Environment
Duration: 00:05

Before diving into the application, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```console
pip install streamlit pandas numpy networkx plotly
```

This command installs Streamlit, Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical computations, NetworkX for graph analysis, and Plotly for interactive visualizations.

## Understanding the Application Structure
Duration: 00:10

The QuLab application is structured as follows:

*   **`app.py`:** This is the main entry point of the application. It sets up the Streamlit interface, including the title, sidebar navigation, and content based on user selection.
*   **`application_pages/`:** This directory contains separate modules for each page of the application:
    *   `representations.py`:  Focuses on different ways to represent market data, including exchange rate matrices and directed graphs.
    *   `arbitrage_cycles.py`:  Implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm to identify arbitrage cycles.
    *   `live_arbitrage.py`: A placeholder for live arbitrage identification, which is not fully implemented in this demo.
    *   `challenges.py`:  Discusses the practical challenges of arbitrage trading.

The `app.py` script uses a `selectbox` in the sidebar to allow the user to navigate between these different sections.  Each section's logic is encapsulated within its respective module, making the code more organized and maintainable.

## Exploring Market Representations
Duration: 00:20

This section, implemented in `application_pages/representations.py`, explores various ways to represent market data, which is crucial for identifying arbitrage opportunities.

### Exchange Rate Matrix
The application starts by displaying an exchange rate matrix using a Pandas DataFrame.

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import plotly.express as px

def run_representations():
    st.subheader("Representations of a Market")

    # Exchange Rate Matrix Representation
    exchange_rate_matrix = pd.DataFrame({
        0: [1.00, 0.58, 0.63, 0.27, 0.17, 0.20],
        1: [1.68, 1.00, 0.39, 0.74, 0.47, 0.79],
        2: [1.57, 2.48, 1.00, 0.04, 0.15, 0.11],
        3: [3.64, 1.35, 22.94, 1.00, 0.22, 0.23],
        4: [5.84, 2.02, 6.84, 4.40, 1.00, 0.49],
        5: [4.76, 1.21, 8.59, 4.41, 1.97, 1.00]
    })

    st.subheader("Exchange Rate Matrix Representation")
    st.write("An exchange rate matrix displays the exchange rates between different currencies.")
    st.dataframe(exchange_rate_matrix)
```

This matrix represents the exchange rates between different currencies (represented by numbers 0 to 5).  For example, the element at `exchange_rate_matrix.iloc[0, 1]` (0.58) represents the exchange rate from currency 0 to currency 1.  Streamlit's `st.dataframe()` function is used to display this matrix in a user-friendly format.

### Directed Graph Representation
Next, the application visualizes the exchange rate matrix as a directed graph using NetworkX and Plotly.

```python
    # Directed Graph Representation
    G = nx.DiGraph()
    for i in range(len(exchange_rate_matrix)):
        for j in range(len(exchange_rate_matrix)):
            G.add_edge(i, j, weight=exchange_rate_matrix.iloc[i, j])

    pos = nx.spring_layout(G)  # You can experiment with different layouts
    edge_labels = {(i, j): round(G[i][j]['weight'], 2) for i, j in G.edges()}

    # Create Plotly graph
    edge_x = []
    edge_y = []
    for edge in G.edges():
        x0, y0 = pos[edge[0]]
        x1, y1 = pos[edge[1]]
        edge_x.append(x0)
        edge_x.append(x1)
        edge_x.append(None)
        edge_y.append(y0)
        edge_y.append(y1)
        edge_y.append(None)

    edge_trace = go.Scatter(
        x=edge_x, y=edge_y,
        line=dict(width=0.5, color='#888'),
        hoverinfo='none',
        mode='lines')

    node_x = []
    node_y = []
    for node in G.nodes():
        x, y = pos[node]
        node_x.append(x)
        node_y.append(y)

    node_trace = go.Scatter(
        x=node_x, y=node_y,
        mode='markers',
        hoverinfo='text',
        marker=dict(
            showscale=True,
            colorscale='YlGnBu',
            reversescale=True,
            color=[],
            size=10,
            colorbar=dict(
                thickness=15,
                title='Node Connections',
                xanchor='left',
                titleside='right'
            ),
            line_width=2))

    node_adjacencies = []
    node_text = []
    for node, adjacencies in enumerate(G.adjacency()):
        node_adjacencies.append(len(adjacencies[1]))
        node_text.append(f"Currency: {node}")

    node_trace.marker.color = node_adjacencies
    node_trace.text = node_text

    fig = go.Figure(data=[edge_trace, node_trace],
                    layout=go.Layout(
                        title='Directed Graph Representation',
                        titlefont_size=16,
                        showlegend=False,
                        hovermode='closest',
                        margin=dict(b=20, l=5, r=5, t=40),
                        annotations=[dict(
                            text="A directed graph represents currencies as nodes and exchange rates as edges.",
                            showarrow=False,
                            xref="paper", yref="paper",
                            x=0.005, y=-0.002)],
                        xaxis=dict(showgrid=False, zeroline=False, showticklabels=False),
                        yaxis=dict(showgrid=False, zeroline=False, showticklabels=False))
                    )
    st.subheader("Directed Graph Representation")
    st.write("A directed graph represents currencies as nodes and exchange rates as edges.")
    st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)
```

In this representation:

*   Each currency is a node in the graph.
*   The exchange rate between two currencies is represented by a directed edge connecting the corresponding nodes. The weight of the edge represents the exchange rate.
*   The code iterates through the exchange rate matrix, adding edges to the graph with the corresponding weights.
*   `nx.spring_layout(G)` is used to determine the position of the nodes in the graph for better visualization. Other layout algorithms like `nx.circular_layout(G)` or `nx.random_layout(G)` can also be used.
*   Plotly is used to create an interactive graph visualization. The code constructs traces for the edges and nodes, specifying their positions, colors, and hover information.
*   `st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)` renders the Plotly graph in the Streamlit application, ensuring it adapts to the container's width.

### Log-Transformed Representations
Finally, the application demonstrates the use of log-transformed exchange rates.

```python
    # Log-Transformed Representations
    log_exchange_rate_matrix = -np.log(exchange_rate_matrix)
    log_exchange_rate_matrix = pd.DataFrame(log_exchange_rate_matrix)
    st.subheader("Log-Transformed Representations")
    st.write("Log transformation converts multiplicative arbitrage detection into an additive problem.")
    st.dataframe(log_exchange_rate_matrix)

    # Create a directed graph from the log-transformed matrix
    G_log = nx.DiGraph()
    for i in range(len(log_exchange_rate_matrix)):
        for j in range(len(log_exchange_rate_matrix)):
            G_log.add_edge(i, j, weight=log_exchange_rate_matrix.iloc[i, j])

    pos_log = nx.spring_layout(G_log)  # You can experiment with different layouts
    edge_labels_log = {(i, j): round(G_log[i][j]['weight'], 2) for i, j in G_log.edges()}

    # Create Plotly graph
    edge_x_log = []
    edge_y_log = []
    for edge in G_log.edges():
        x0, y0 = pos_log[edge[0]]
        x1, y1 = pos_log[edge[1]]
        edge_x_log.append(x0)
        edge_x_log.append(x1)
        edge_x_log.append(None)
        edge_y_log.append(y0)
        edge_y_log.append(y1)
        edge_y_log.append(None)

    edge_trace_log = go.Scatter(
        x=edge_x_log, y=edge_y_log,
        line=dict(width=0.5, color='#888'),
        hoverinfo='none',
        mode='lines')

    node_x_log = []
    node_y_log = []
    for node in G_log.nodes():
        x, y = pos_log[node]
        node_x_log.append(x)
        node_y_log.append(y)

    node_trace_log = go.Scatter(
        x=node_x_log, y=node_y_log,
        mode='markers',
        hoverinfo='text',
        marker=dict(
            showscale=True,
            colorscale='YlGnBu',
            reversescale=True,
            color=[],
            size=10,
            colorbar=dict(
                thickness=15,
                title='Node Connections',
                xanchor='left',
                titleside='right'
            ),
            line_width=2))

    node_adjacencies_log = []
    node_text_log = []
    for node, adjacencies in enumerate(G_log.adjacency()):
        node_adjacencies_log.append(len(adjacencies[1]))
        node_text_log.append(f"Currency: {node}")

    node_trace_log.marker.color = node_adjacencies_log
    node_trace_log.text = node_text_log

    fig_log = go.Figure(data=[edge_trace_log, node_trace_log],
                    layout=go.Layout(
                        title='Log-Transformed Directed Graph Representation',
                        titlefont_size=16,
                        showlegend=False,
                        hovermode='closest',
                        margin=dict(b=20, l=5, r=5, t=40),
                        annotations=[dict(
                            text="Log transformation converts multiplicative arbitrage detection into an additive problem.",
                            showarrow=False,
                            xref="paper", yref="paper",
                            x=0.005, y=-0.002)],
                        xaxis=dict(showgrid=False, zeroline=False, showticklabels=False),
                        yaxis=dict(showgrid=False, zeroline=False, showticklabels=False))
                    )
    st.subheader("Log-Transformed Directed Graph Representation")
    st.write("A directed graph represents currencies as nodes and log-transformed exchange rates as edges.")
    st.plotly_chart(fig_log, use_container_width=True)
```

Taking the negative logarithm of the exchange rates converts the multiplicative problem of finding an arbitrage cycle (where the product of exchange rates exceeds 1) into an additive problem (finding a negative cycle).  This transformation allows us to use algorithms like Bellman-Ford to efficiently detect arbitrage opportunities. The code then visualizes the log-transformed exchange rates as another directed graph, similar to the previous one.

## Identifying Arbitrage Cycles
Duration: 00:25

This section, implemented in `application_pages/arbitrage_cycles.py`, demonstrates how to identify arbitrage cycles using the Bellman-Ford algorithm.

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

def run_arbitrage_cycles():
    st.subheader("Identifying Arbitrage Cycles")
    st.subheader("Finding an Arbitrage Cycle with Bellman-Ford")
    st.write("The Bellman-Ford algorithm detects negative cycles, indicating arbitrage opportunities in the log-transformed graph.")

    # Example exchange rate matrix (same as in representations.py)
    exchange_rate_matrix = pd.DataFrame({
        0: [1.00, 0.58, 0.63, 0.27, 0.17, 0.20],
        1: [1.68, 1.00, 0.39, 0.74, 0.47, 0.79],
        2: [1.57, 2.48, 1.00, 0.04, 0.15, 0.11],
        3: [3.64, 1.35, 22.94, 1.00, 0.22, 0.23],
        4: [5.84, 2.02, 6.84, 4.40, 1.00, 0.49],
        5: [4.76, 1.21, 8.59, 4.41, 1.97, 1.00]
    })

    # Log-transformed exchange rate matrix
    log_exchange_rate_matrix = -np.log(exchange_rate_matrix)
    log_exchange_rate_matrix = pd.DataFrame(log_exchange_rate_matrix)

    # Create a directed graph from the log-transformed matrix
    G_log = nx.DiGraph()
    for i in range(len(log_exchange_rate_matrix)):
        for j in range(len(log_exchange_rate_matrix)):
            G_log.add_edge(i, j, weight=log_exchange_rate_matrix.iloc[i, j])


    def bf_negative_cycle(graph):
        dist = {node: float('inf') for node in graph.nodes()}
        pred = {node: None for node in graph.nodes()}
        start_node = 0
        dist[start_node] = 0

        for _ in range(len(graph.nodes()) - 1):
            for u, v, weight in graph.edges(data='weight'):
                if dist[u] != float('inf') and dist[u] + weight < dist[v]:
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + weight
                    pred[v] = u

        for u, v, weight in graph.edges(data='weight'):
            if dist[u] != float('inf') and dist[u] + weight < dist[v]:
                # Negative cycle detected. Construct the cycle.
                cycle = []
                curr = v
                visited = {node: False for node in graph.nodes()}
                while not visited[curr]:
                    visited[curr] = True
                    cycle.append(curr)
                    curr = pred[curr]
                    if curr is None:
                        return None  # No cycle
                cycle.append(curr)
                return cycle[::-1]  # Reverse the cycle to the correct order
        return None

    arbitrage_cycle = bf_negative_cycle(G_log)

    if arbitrage_cycle:
        st.write("Arbitrage Cycle Found:", arbitrage_cycle)
        cycle_weight = sum(G_log[arbitrage_cycle[i]][arbitrage_cycle[(i + 1) % len(arbitrage_cycle)]]['weight']
                           for i in range(len(arbitrage_cycle)))
        arbitrage_multiplier = np.exp(-cycle_weight)  # undo log transform and negative
        st.write("Arbitrage Multiplier:", arbitrage_multiplier)
    else:
        st.write("No Arbitrage Cycle Found.")


    st.subheader("Finding an 'Optimal' Set of Cycles")
    st.write("Finding the absolute best set of arbitrage trades is computationally hard (NP-hard).")
    st.write("This section would demonstrate a simplified problem using linear programming relaxation via CVXPY.")
    st.write("Implementation of CVXPY to find optimal cycle is omitted from this demo due to complexity and lack of specification in the prompt.")
```

The `bf_negative_cycle` function implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm:

1.  **Initialization:** It initializes the distance to each node to infinity, except for the starting node (node 0), which is set to 0.  It also initializes a `pred` dictionary to keep track of the predecessor of each node in the shortest path.
2.  **Relaxation:** It iterates `len(graph.nodes()) - 1` times, relaxing each edge in the graph.  Relaxing an edge `(u, v)` means checking if the distance to `v` can be shortened by going through `u`.  If `dist[u] + weight < dist[v]`, then `dist[v]` is updated to `dist[u] + weight`, and `pred[v]` is set to `u`.
3.  **Negative Cycle Detection:** After the relaxation steps, it iterates through the edges again.  If it finds an edge `(u, v)` for which `dist[u] + weight < dist[v]`, it means there is a negative cycle in the graph. The code then reconstructs the cycle by traversing back from `v` to its predecessors until it reaches the starting node again.

If a negative cycle (arbitrage cycle) is found, the application displays the cycle and calculates the arbitrage multiplier. The arbitrage multiplier indicates the potential profit from exploiting the arbitrage opportunity.

The section also mentions the complexity of finding the *optimal* set of arbitrage cycles, which is an NP-hard problem.  It notes that a linear programming relaxation approach using CVXPY could be used, but the implementation is omitted from this demo.

## Simulating Live Arbitrage Identification
Duration: 00:05

The `application_pages/live_arbitrage.py` file provides a placeholder for live arbitrage identification.

```python
import streamlit as st

def run_live_arbitrage():
    st.subheader("Live Arbitrage Identification")
    st.write("This section would fetch live data from crypto exchanges using CCXT.")
    st.write("Due to the complexity of integrating with live exchanges and the lack of specific requirements, "
             "this section will display a placeholder message.")
    st.write("Fetching and processing live data is not implemented in this demo.")
```

In a real-world application, this section would:

1.  Use a library like CCXT to connect to various cryptocurrency exchanges.
2.  Fetch live price data for different currency pairs.
3.  Apply the arbitrage detection logic (e.g., Bellman-Ford algorithm) to the live data.
4.  Display potential arbitrage opportunities in real-time.

However, due to the complexities of integrating with live exchanges, this functionality is not implemented in this demo.

## Understanding Practical Challenges
Duration: 00:10

The `application_pages/challenges.py` module discusses the practical challenges of arbitrage trading.

```python
import streamlit as st

def run_challenges():
    st.subheader("Practical Challenges of Arbitrage Trading")
    st.write("Arbitrage trading faces several practical challenges:")
    challenges_list = [
        "**Speed:** The faster you can execute trades, the higher chance to profit.",
        "**Timing Issues:** Market conditions change rapidly, and arbitrage opportunities can disappear quickly.",
        "**Costs of Inventory:** Holding crypto inventory incurs costs (e.g., opportunity cost, storage fees).",
        "**Available Liquidity:** Sufficient liquidity is needed to execute large arbitrage trades without significantly impacting prices.",
        "**Precision:** Accurate price data and order execution are crucial for profitability.",
        "**Error Handling:** Robust error handling is necessary to deal with unexpected issues (e.g., exchange downtime)."
    ]
    for challenge in challenges_list:
        st.write(f"- {challenge}")
```

This section highlights the difficulties faced in real-world arbitrage trading, such as speed requirements, timing issues, inventory costs, liquidity constraints, the need for precision, and the importance of robust error handling. Understanding these challenges is crucial for anyone considering implementing an arbitrage trading strategy.

## Running the Application

This command will start the Streamlit server and open the application in your web browser. You can then use the sidebar navigation to explore the different sections of the application and interact with the visualizations.

## Conclusion
Duration: 00:05

This codelab has provided a comprehensive guide to the QuLab application, explaining its functionalities, underlying concepts, and implementation details. By exploring the different sections of the application, you have gained a better understanding of how arbitrage opportunities can be identified and the practical challenges associated with exploiting them.  This application serves as a valuable educational tool for anyone interested in learning more about arbitrage trading and its complexities. Remember that the "Live Arbitrage Identification" section is a placeholder and would require significant additional work to implement live data fetching and processing.
