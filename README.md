# Crypto Trading and Arbitrage Identification Strategies

This Streamlit application demonstrates various concepts related to cryptocurrency arbitrage, including market representations, arbitrage cycle identification, and live arbitrage identification.

## Red Flags and Considerations

*   **matplotlib Usage:** The code uses `matplotlib` for graph visualization, while the instructions specify `plotly`. This should be changed to use `plotly` for better interactivity.
*   **No Error Handling:** The code lacks proper error handling, especially for the Bellman-Ford algorithm. It should include checks for invalid input data and handle potential exceptions gracefully.
*   **No Live Data Integration:** The "Live Arbitrage Identification" section is just a placeholder. Integrating with a real-time data source like CCXT requires careful security considerations and API key management, which are not addressed in this simplified version.
*   **Simplified Bellman-Ford:** The Bellman-Ford implementation is simplified and may not be robust enough for real-world arbitrage detection.
*   **Missing CVXPY implementation:** The "Optimal" Set of Cycles section mentions a linear programming relaxation via CVXPY, but its implementation is missing in the current code.
